# Tic Tac Toe

A Tic Tac Toe application in which the users can play against a computer with varying levels of difficulty, with another player locally or with other users online.

## Description

A simple application in which my biggest aim was to demonstrate the ability to use some key react native concepts while simultaneously continuing to learn. 
In this application I implemented custom authentication with AWS Amplify and AWS Cognito, and I also manipulated data in various ways using DataStore.

### Installing

* The application can be found in the Google Play Store [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pdob.tictactoe)
