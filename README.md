# Tic Tac Toe

A Tic Tac Toe application in which the users can play against a computer with varying levels of difficulty, with another player locally or with other users online.

## Description

A simple application in which my biggest aim was to demonstrate the ability to use some key react native concepts while simultaneously continuing to learn. 
In this application I implemented custom authentication with AWS Amplify and AWS Cognito, and I also manipulated data in various ways using DataStore.

### Installing

* The application is currently pending Play Store upload, so in the meantime the .apk file can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aNhPZ-5Xz5NYTmBb_VAnLH8SBW0Wntb2/view?usp=sharing)
